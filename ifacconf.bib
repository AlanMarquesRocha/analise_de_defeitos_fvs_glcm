abstract = {With lower consumer prices and the boom in solar PV module sales there has been a rapid increase in the number of PV modules installed on roof tops. In some instances, noticeable changes in the visual appearance of these modules have been observed, such as the occurrence of ‘snail trails’ or microcracks or discolouration. These changes raise concerns that the modules may be defective or not performing as warranted. We have examined a number of these problematic modules and identified several common defects that have appeared on installations around Australia and the effect that these defects have on the output of the individual solar modules. Results from a series of studies of modules showing these defects have been systematised and presented in this paper.}

abstract = {Electroluminescent imaging is increasingly used to detect defects in silicon solar cells. However, the cost of the conventional luminescence systems is a limiting factor for generalized use. A simple and reliable low-cost electroluminescence setup is presented. The developed system was tested on commercial silicon solar cells for the acquisition of electroluminescence images in the forward and reverse bias regimes. In forward bias the temperature was varied whilst in reverse bias the applied voltage was varied. The results used in conjunction allowed for the detection of defective areas and identification of their type and cause. The simplicity and low-cost nature of the developed setup should enable a more widespread use of luminescence techniques for the characterization of crystalline silicon solar cells.}

abstract = {The maintenance of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plants is considered as an outstanding challenge for years. This paper presented a deep learning-based defect detection of PV modules using electroluminescence images through addressing two technical challenges: (1) providing a large number of high-quality Electroluminescence (EL) image generation method for the limit of EL image samples; and (2) an efficient model for automatic defect classification with the generated EL image. The EL image generation approach combines traditional image processing technology and GAN characteristics. It can produce a large number of EL image samples with high resolution using a limited number of samples. Then, a convolution neural network (CNN) based model for the automatic classification of defects in an EL image is presented. CNN is used to extract the deep feature of the EL image. It can greatly increase the accuracy and efficiency of PV modules inspection and health management in comparison with the other solutions. The proposed solution is assessed through extensive experiments by using the existing machine learning models, VGG16, ResNet50, Inception V3 and MobileNet, as the comparison benchmarks. The numerical results confirm that the proposed deep learning-based solution can carry out efficient and accurate defect detection automatically using the electroluminescence images.}

  abstract  = {Effective fault diagnosis in a PV system requires understanding the behavior of the current/voltage (I/V) parameters in different environmental conditions. Especially during the winter season, I/V characters of certain faulty states in a PV system closely resemble that of a normal state. Therefore, a normal fault detection model can falsely predict a well-operating PV system as a faulty state and vice versa. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis model is proposed for the fault detection and classification in PV systems. For the experimental verification, various fault state and normal state datasets are collected during the winter season under wide environmental conditions. The collected datasets are normalized and preprocessed using several data-mining techniques and then fed into a probabilistic neural network (PNN). The PNN model will be trained with the historical data to predict and classify faults when new data is fetched in it. The trained model showed better performance in prediction accuracy when compared with other classification methods in machine learning.},

  abstract  = {The environmentally clean nature of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology causes PV power generation to be embraced by all countries across the globe. Consequently, installation and utilization of PV power systems have seen much growth in recent years. Although PV arrays of such systems are robust, they are not immune to faults. To guarantee reliable power supply, economic returns, and safety of both humans and equipment, highly accurate fault detection, diagnosis, and interruption devices are required. In this paper, an overview of four major PV array faults and their causes are presented. Specifically, ground fault, line-line fault, arc fault, and hot spot fault have been covered. Next, conventional and advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques for managing these faults are reviewed. Moreover, a single evaluation metric has been proposed and utilized to evaluate the performances of the advanced FDD techniques. Finally, based on the papers reviewed, PV array fault management future trends and possible recommendations have been outlined.},
